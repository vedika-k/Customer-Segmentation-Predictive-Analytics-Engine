# Customer-Segmentation-Predictive-Analytics-Engine

## Overview

This research explores customer behavior in the telecommunications industry using data-driven segmentation and predictive analytics to enhance customer retention and satisfaction. By examining customer demographics, usage patterns, and service subscriptions, the study uncovers actionable insights that telecom companies can leverage to create more effective marketing strategies, reduce churn, and improve customer experiences.

## Project Goals

- **Customer Segmentation**: Identify and analyze distinct customer groups based on usage, demographics, and service subscriptions to target marketing efforts effectively.
- **Churn Prediction**: Develop predictive models to understand why customers leave and assess retention strategies.
- **Service Improvement Insights**: Provide recommendations for service adjustments based on customer feedback and usage analysis.

## Dataset

The project uses the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which contains over 157,000 records with features including customer demographics, service details (phone, internet, etc.), and account information. This data enables a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and churn risk.

### Dataset Source
- IBM Data Analytics team via data-sharing platforms such as Kaggle and GitHub.

### Preprocessing Steps
1. Handling missing values with median imputation.
2. Encoding categorical variables with one-hot encoding for multi-level categories.
3. Normalizing numerical features using standard scaling techniques.

## Problem Statement

The telecommunications industry faces challenges in understanding customer needs amidst evolving technology and service landscapes. Our research addresses critical obstacles:
- **Data Accuracy and Privacy**: Ensuring reliable data collection and adhering to data protection regulations.
- **Actionable Insights**: Transforming analytical results into implementable business strategies.
- **Customer Adaptation**: Continuously adjusting to shifting customer preferences in a competitive market.

## Methodology

The research methodology includes a series of analytical and machine learning steps to derive actionable insights:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and imputation.
- Utilized vectorization and scaling to prepare features for clustering and predictive modeling.
- Employed down-sampling to balance the dataset.

### 2. Data Modeling
- **Clustering**: Utilized KMeans for customer segmentation to identify distinct groups based on similar characteristics.
- **Classification Models**: Tested models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, and Logistic Regression to predict customer churn with high accuracy.

### 3. Cloud Deployment
- **AWS SageMaker**: Deployed the model on AWS SageMaker to enable scalability and remote access.
  - Created a storage bucket for data files.
  - Set up a SageMaker domain with security policies for collaborative work.
  - Executed the model within a Jupyter notebook environment on AWS.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Used heatmaps, bar charts, and boxplots for in-depth visual exploration of customer behavior and churn patterns.

## Results

The analysis identified distinct customer segments, and the predictive models achieved high accuracy scores. Key results include:
- **Customer Segmentation**: KMeans clustering revealed actionable customer groups with specific behavioral traits.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - **Random Forest**: Achieved an accuracy of 0.976 with balanced precision and recall.
  - **Gradient Boost Classifier**: Followed closely with an accuracy of 0.967.
  - Visualizations like correlation heatmaps and churn ratios helped illustrate model insights.

## Key Findings and Insights

- **Customer Groups**: Clear segmentation enables telecom companies to focus marketing efforts on high-value groups.
- **Churn Factors**: Service quality, pricing, and customer support emerged as significant drivers of churn.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Recommendations include refining customer support, revising pricing models, and introducing targeted promotions for at-risk groups.

## Limitations and Future Work

While the study offers valuable insights, it also acknowledges limitations:
- **Data Scope**: Limited to a specific subset of telecom data, which may affect generalizability.
- **Feature Set**: Only a limited number of features were analyzed, leaving potential for further improvement with additional data.

### Future Directions
1. **Expand Dataset**: Integrate additional customer data for enhanced model performance.
2. **Advanced Models**: Explore deep learning techniques and unsupervised methods for more granular segmentation.
3. **Impact Analysis**: Conduct studies on the impact of implementing suggested strategies on customer retention and loyalty.

## Conclusion

This research provides telecom companies with a structured approach to leveraging customer data for segmentation and churn prediction. By understanding customer needs and pain points, companies can adapt their strategies, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and reduced churn. Future research could expand the dataset and explore advanced analytical methods to deepen the understanding of customer behavior.
